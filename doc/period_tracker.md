# Using the period tracker

## Basic data entry

Click the Period link on the main site menu and select "list" (or go to yoursite.com/period/list). Click the "Add new" link in the upper right to open the period data entry form. The form includes the following fields:

- **Date**

  This is the only mandatory field; the rest of the data is nearly useless without it.

- **Temperature time**

  Time when temperature was taken, if known.

- **Temperature**

  Body temperature, typically measured upon waking

- **Period intensity**

  Perceived intensity of period flow for the day, with the following options:

  | Value |  Meaning             |
  |-------|----------------------|
  | None  |No period             |
  |   .   |Spotting or very light|
  |   -   |Light                 |
  |   +   |Medium                |
  |   *   |Heavy                 |
  |   #   |Very heavy            |

- **Cervical fluid**

  Perceived character of cervical fluid

  | Value    | Meaning |
  |----------|---------|
  | Sticky   | Light   |
  | Creamy   | Medium  |
  | Eggwhite | Heavy   |

- **LH Surge**

  Whether luteal hormone was detected (using an ovulation predictor kit test strip). Values are "Not measured" (default), "Negative test" or "Positive test".

## Menstrual flow measurements

The "menstrual cup fill" and "absorbent garment weights" pages provide a way to record quantitative measurements of menstrual bleeding. This is accomplished by measuring the amount of blood collected in a menstrual cup or in an absorbent garment such as a pad or absorbent underwear.

The menstrual cup records consist of insertion and removal times for a menstrual cup, along with the amount of blood in the cup at time of removal. From this an average flow rate can be computed in mL/h.

The absorbent garment records are slightly more complicated, requiring one to select the garment in use (additional garments can be added in the "Manage absorbent garments" page), and the weights of the garment before and after use. The weight prior to wear may be saved at time of measuring and the record edited later to add the weight after the garment was worn. 

The software computes a flow rate for the absorbent garment under the following assumptions: 1) The difference in weights is assumed to equal the mass in grams of blood absorbed by the garment, and 2) The mass of blood in grams is assumed to equal the blood volume in milliliters. These assumptions may be invalid if the garment absorbs a significant amount of other fluids (such as sweat or water) during wear.

The flow rate in mL/hour is plotted in the lower panel of the period plot page, and the total flow for each day is shown in the list page for period records.
